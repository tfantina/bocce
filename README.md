# Bocce 🔴🔵
## Open source social micro-network by Travis Fantina

### Bocce in a nutshell 🥜
Bocce was created by Travis Fantina with a twofold mission.

1. First and foremost I wanted to expand my knowledge of the Rails framework
 and best development practices such as TDD and proper version control.
That's the personal and far less important or interesting aspect of this
 project.

2. As the "major" social networks continue absorb more and more information
about their users; in the interest of increasing shareholder value, by
essentially coming up with new and innovative ways to get users to click
on advertisements it seems that there is a need for a kinder, gentler social
network with the aim of connecting people, sharing photos, meet-ups and
keeping in touch. Bocce is or your friends, family and co-workers, there
is no place for fake news (or really news at all), huge friend lists and
endlessly ❤️ posts circulating across millions of people's feeds.  
We'll never make a billion dollars but hopefully this will be a fun experiment.

### Social micro-network  🔬
* Some more information on a social micro-network.
Is it possible to have a meaningful interaction with 1000+ connections?  I
don't think so, I'm not saying that there isn't the place for large extended
networks but Bocce is not the place. Your friends list is capped at 99.
Already have 99 friends when you meet somebody new to add?  That's cool,
Bocce will unfriend the friend with whom you haven't interacted with
in the longest keeping your friends list neat and tidy.

  * No sharing.  You will have the ability to like and comment on others posts
  however let their stuff be their own.  Again, there is a place for artists to
  spread their work and where memes flourish but it's not Bocce.
  * No news.  If you've some news you want to share put it in a message.

### Governance 👩‍⚖️
While version 1.0 is in development I, Travis Fantina, will take 100% control
over development.  In future versions I welcome open source contributions,
bug fixes and suggestions.  Depending on how the network grows and develops
 at some future time I will force myself to learn more about the legalese
 of the open source licences and choose on that best fits the community.  

As I am currently the sole developer and creator of this project I have 100%
ownership and control: for now...  Again, as the community grows and develops
a more democratic process may evolve.
