<h1>Qu'est-ce que c'est, Bocce🔴🔵?</h1>
<p>Bocce an (eventually) open source Micro-Social Network.  It is still
  under development by Travis Fantina, hence the still closed source nature
  of the project.  Once it's ready we will fork🍴 and open source the project.
</p>
<h2>What is a Micro-Social Network?</h2>
<p>In an age where social networking has become about amassing as many friends
as possible Bocce🔴🔵 aims to scale this back. With Bocce🔴🔵 you only get 99
friends, add a 100th and you will automatically unfriend the friend whom you
haven't interacted with the longest. We realize that this is a strict constraint
but rather than promotion, Bocce🔴🔵 is about contributing to personal,
meaningful relationships rather than building large networks. Not that there
isn't a place for that, this is just not it.
</p>
<h2>Why Bocce🔴🔵?</h2>
<p><ul>
  <li>
    <strong>No algorithms.</strong> We want you to have an authentic and
    genuine experience on this network.  We're not going to push stories we
    think you'd like, we won't promote junk, because you liked it once a year
    ago. The information you see will be shown to you in chronological order
    as it happens based on what your contacts show. Period.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>We won't sell your data.</strong> At the moment we don't have a
    formal revenue model, as this is largely an experiment, we may take a
    non-profit donation route, find a service we can sell or have unobtrusive
    advertising of some kind but we won't be giving your likes, dislikes, age,
    name, address, browsing history or anything else to our advertisers. This
    spells a huge pay cut but we think it will be better for everyone
    involved.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>No news.</strong> We're about reconnecting with old friends,
    sharing memories with family and creating a beautiful community. If you
    want the news tune in to CNN.
